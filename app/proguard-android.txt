#Specifies to assign the same obfuscated names to class members that have the same names,
#  and different obfuscated names to class members that have different names (for each given class member signature).
#  Without the option, more class members can be mapped to the same short names like 'a', 'b', etc.
#  The option therefore increases the size of the resulting code slightly, but it ensures
#  that the saved obfuscation name mapping can always be respected in subsequent incremental obfuscation steps.
# For instance, consider two distinct interfaces containing methods with the same name and signature.
#  Without this option, these methods may get different obfuscated names in a first obfuscation step. If a patch is then added containing a class that implements both interfaces, ProGuard will have to enforce the same method name for both methods in an incremental obfuscation step. The original obfuscated code is changed, in order to keep the resulting code consistent.
# With this option in the initial obfuscation step, such renaming will never be necessary.

# Optimization is turned off by default. Dex does not like code run
# through the ProGuard optimize and preverify steps (and performs some
# of these optimizations on its own).

# Note that if you want to enable optimization, you cannot just
# include optimization flags in your own project configuration file;
# instead you will need to point to the
# "proguard-android-optimize.txt" file instead of this one from your
# project.properties file.
